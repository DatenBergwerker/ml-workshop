# ml-workshop
Set of scripts for an introductory Machine Learning workshop at the University of Mannheim. 
The content is focused around different aspects of scikit-learn and shows the library's features and API
on a simple dataframe. The code serves as a skeleton for simple ML pipelines and useful data structures. 
The datasets are available on kaggle (bank marketing data, world bank data, agriculturual yield data).
